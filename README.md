# AgEagleVPRDataset
The datasets provided by the AgEagle are suitable for the aerial-based VPR task. We collect the corresponding satellite map and make them in a standard format for the VPR task evaluation.

The original datasets are publicly downloaded from the AgEagle website at [this link](https://ageagle.com/resources/?filter_by=data-set).
